        Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; commonly stylized as BLACKPINK or BLΛƆKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group
        formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. The group debuted in
        August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their
        first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard World Digital Song
        Sales chart, respectively.

Blackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with
 "Ice Cream" (2020), and on the Billboard 200, peaking at number two with The Album (2020), the first-ever
album by a Korean girl group to sell more than one million copies.They were the first Korean girl group
to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart and to top the Billboard World Digital Song Sales
chart three times. Blackpink was also the first female Korean act to receive a certification from 
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with their hit single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018),
whose music video is currently the most-viewed by a Korean group on YouTube. They have the most 
top 40 hits in the United Kingdom among all Korean artists, and their 2018 song "Kiss and Make Up",
a collaboration with Dua Lipa, was the first by a Korean group to receive a certification from the
British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and a platinum certification from the Australian Recording
Industry Association (ARIA).

Blackpink has broken numerous online records throughout their career. Their music videos for
 "Kill This Love" (2019) and "How You Like That" (2020) each set records for the most-viewed
music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking three and setting
two Guinness World Records. They are also the first music group and Korean act to have four
music videos each accumulating one billion views on YouTube. Blackpink is currently the most-followed
girl group on Spotify and the most-subscribed music group, female act, and Asian act on YouTube. Their
other accolades include the New Artist of the Year Award at the 31st Golden Disc Awards and the 26th
Seoul Music Awards, the Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Female Group in 2020, an MTV Music Video Award
(first win by K-pop girl group), and recognition as the first female Korean group on Forbes'
30 Under 30 Asia. They have been recognized by Forbes Korea as one of the most powerful
celebrities in South Korea, placing first in 2019, third in 2020, and second in 2021.
