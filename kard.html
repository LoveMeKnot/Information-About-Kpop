        <h1>About Kard</h1>
            <div class="container">
               <p>Kard (Korean: 카드, stylized as K.A.R.D or KARD) is a South Korean co-ed group formed by DSP Media. They are composed of members J.Seph, BM, Somin, and Jiwoo. They officially debuted on July 19, 2017, with their extended play Hola Hola.KARD's brand of K-pop has been described as "undeniably trendy", with their discography focusing on contemporary house and dancehall vibes, which Billboard has referred to as something that is "pulled directly from Top 40 charts". The group's musical style diverges from electropop, hip hop, EDM, and alt-R&B that was known to have been trending in the American music market by the time of their pre-debut. The group was also noted for their reggaetón and moombahton styling that resonated with international K-pop fans, which was stated by Billboard to be one of the primary reasons why they were able to tour throughout North and South America even prior to releasing their first mini-album. While they are largely inspired by Latin dance music trends, KARD has stated that they are continuously studying other genres in order to keep showing new sides to their music style. A notable shift in KARD's sonic style was first seen through the release of their single "Dumb Litty", which incorporated dancehall alongside synth, trap, and EDM. Following the release of their fourth EP, Red Moon, member BM has dubbed moombahton as "a symbol of KARD".

                The group's nature in their sonic base is apparent in the members' personal musical influences: BM cites American rapper Tupac and J.Cole as his inspiration, J.Seph cites Korean rapper Beenzino, Somin takes inspiration from Tinashe and Ariana Grande, while member Jiwoo cites Beyonce and Rihanna.
