        NCT  is a South Korean boy group formed by SM Entertainment. NCT stands for Neo Culture
         Technology. The group is divided into multiple sub-units. Since the group's initial introduction by
          their native label's founder in January 2016, the group consists of 23 members as of April 2021,
           ranging from their late-teens to mid-twenties and participating in a total of four different 
           sub-units.

The group introduced their first unit, the rotational NCT U, on April 9, 2016 with the double digital single
 "The 7th Sense" and "Without You". It was followed by the Seoul-based unit NCT 127 on July 7, 2016 with their 
 eponymous extended play and later the then-teenage only unit NCT Dream on August 24, 2016 with the digital 
 single "Chewing Gum". The group then introduced their first overseas localized sub-unit WayV, a seven-member 
 unit based in China, on January 17, 2019 with the single album The Vision. A fifth unit is set to debut in 
 2021, followed by their second overseas localized sub-unit NCT-Hollywood, a unit based in the United States, 
 at a later date.

Along with separate activities of each group unit, the umbrella group NCT to date has united twice to promote 
full-length albums, the first time being the 2018 March release of NCT 2018 Empathy and the second was the 2020 
October and November release of the two-part album NCT 2020 Resonance Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 which together sold over 
2.6 million copies within two months, establishing itself as the highest-selling physical album ever released 
by an act from SM entertainment and earned the group their first Grand Daesang Award at the 2020 Asia Artist 
Awards.
